		<h3>What are "retro video games"?</h3>
		<p>Retro video games are games from an era long passed. Back when Nintendo was a juggernaut, SEGA was vying for that number one spot, and when Playstation wasn't number one. It was a much simpler time, with way simpler games. Retro video games come from a time when it was one and done; there was no day one patch or microtransactions. You released the game and it was out there.<p>	
		<p>My website aims to chronicle retro gaming and act as sort of a document for others to reference if need be. I aim to document everything to the best of my ability. If you would like to contact me, my Discord tag is Sandvich Thief#0179, and I would be glad to talk about any sort of ammendments or updates you think could be implemented.</p>
